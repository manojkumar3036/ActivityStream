# ActivityStream
Core functionality – Creates an activity or event stream for users based on their subscriptions to communities. At a fundamental level, every user has an inbox and an outbox. Messages are emitted from an outbox and the engine then determines all user inboxes that this message should become part of. There are circles – groups of people that come together for any purpose. Once a circle is created, then this becomes a target for communication. Messages are sent within and even across circles. The stream of messages in a circle is the activity stream of that circle. Messages have tags. They can be filtered based on tags. Tags are system and user defined.Messages model actions on certain data types. They therefore have URLs for actions that they can carry. Example – see a blog post. This has URL to the blog post, and invokes a reader to see the blog post. This is software extensible. The messages themselves are immutable, however messages can be replied to.Messages can be deleted in a person’s inbox but they don’t get deleted from the original activity stream
